# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)
-   And a lot of patience for this git stuff

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(rebus)
library(tidytext)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
cocktail_data <- read.delim("~/R/cocktail-balance/cocktail_data.tsv")
view(cocktail_data)
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
alcohol_remove <- "\\(" %R% DGT %R% DGT %R% "%" %R%  " " %R% "abv\\)"
text_remove <- or("oz", "dashes", "drops")
number_remove <- DGT %R% or(" ", "\\/")
rest_remove <- DGT %R% "." %R% DGT %R% DGT
alcohol_remove2 <- "\\(" %R% DGT %R% DGT %R% "." %R% DGT %R% "%" %R%  " " %R% "abv\\)"
cocktail_data <- cocktail_data %>%
    mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, pattern = alcohol_remove)) %>%
   mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, pattern = text_remove)) %>%
   mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, pattern = number_remove)) %>%
    mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, pattern = rest_remove)) %>%
    mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, pattern = alcohol_remove2))
    
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
cocktail_data <- cocktail_data %>%
     mutate(ingredients = str_replace_all(ingredients, "\\<br\\/\\>", ","))
cocktail_data <- cocktail_data %>%
     mutate(ingredients = str_replace_all(ingredients, "\\<br\\>", ","))
cocktail_data <- cocktail_data %>%
     mutate(ingredients = str_replace_all(ingredients, "\\<b\\>", ","))
cocktail_data <- cocktail_data %>%
    unnest_tokens(unnested_tokens, ingredients, token = stringr::str_split, pattern = ",")
cocktail_data <- cocktail_data %>%
    mutate(unnested_tokens = str_trim(cocktail_data$unnested_tokens, side = "both"))
cocktail_data %>%
     count(unnested_tokens)
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients
#There are 69 ingredients as there are 69 rows displayed by the count function

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
cocktail_data %>%
     count(unnested_tokens)
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
cocktail_data %>%
     count(unnested_tokens) %>%
     top_n(15) %>%
     arrange(desc(n))
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
cocktail_data %>%
          count(name, sort = TRUE)
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
one_ingredient_table <- cocktail_data %>%
          count(unnested_tokens, sort = TRUE) %>%
    filter(n==1)
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
unnest_data <- cocktail_data %>%
    count(unnested_tokens)
table_together <- left_join(cocktail_data, unnest_data)
rear_ingredient_cocktail <- table_together %>%
    filter(n == 1) %>%
     distinct(name)

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
no_rear_ingredient_cocktail <- anti_join(table_together, rear_ingredient_cocktail, by = "name") %>%
    distinct(name)

```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
